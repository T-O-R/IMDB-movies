# IMDB-movies
Built in Tableau — the dashboard highlights what matters fast so viewers can compare top movies at-a-glance and drill into one title for details.

## Project Goal
Main objective of this project is to improve dashboard design and to get comfortable to other functions.
Enable users to interactively explore top movies by different categories.

## Overview
We wanted to know which movies are on top 10, top Actors, top Director etc..
